# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The game has been made user friendly with proper use of android framework components which allows users to play the basic Tic-Tac-Toe game on their android phones and displays the status after the end of each game without interruption.
